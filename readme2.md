# 🚀 GitHub Actions CI Workflow – Practical Implementation Report

This report outlines the practical steps I followed to implement a GitHub Actions workflow for a simple Node.js application. It includes automated testing, code quality checks, matrix builds, and deployment to AWS EC2 using GitHub Actions.

---

## 1. ✅ Initializing the GitHub Repository

I began by creating a new repository on GitHub and cloning it to my local machine. This provided the foundation for version control and integration with GitHub Actions.

---

## 2. 🛠️ Creating a Simple Node.js Application

I initialized a Node.js project using:

```bash
npm init -y
```

Then, I created a basic Express server in `index.js`:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World!');
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`App listening at http://localhost:${port}`);
});

module.exports = app;
```

I committed and pushed the code to GitHub using:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit with Express server"
git push origin main
```

---

## 3. ✅ Writing and Running Automation Tests

To ensure my application behaves as expected, I wrote automated tests using `jest` and `supertest`.

### Installation

```bash
npm install --save-dev jest supertest
```

### Test File: `app.test.js`

```javascript
const request = require('supertest');
const app = require('./index');

describe('GET /', () => {
  it('responds with Hello World!', async () => {
    const response = await request(app).get('/');
    expect(response.status).toBe(200);
    expect(response.text).toBe('Hello World!');
  });
});
```

### Updated package.json Scripts

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "node index.js",
  "test": "jest",
  "lint": "eslint .",
  "lint:fix": "eslint . --fix",
  "build": "echo 'Build step completed'"
}
```

---

## 4. 🎯 Implementing Matrix Builds for Multiple Node.js Versions

To ensure compatibility across different Node.js environments, I implemented matrix builds that test across multiple versions simultaneously. This approach increases efficiency by running jobs in parallel across different Node.js versions.

### Benefits of Matrix Builds:
- **Cross-version compatibility**: Tests your application against multiple Node.js versions
- **Parallel execution**: Runs tests simultaneously, reducing overall build time
- **Early detection**: Identifies version-specific issues before deployment

---

## 5. 🔍 Integrating Code Quality Checks with ESLint

I added comprehensive code quality checks to maintain coding standards and catch potential issues early in the development process.

### ESLint Configuration: `.eslintrc.json`

```json
{
  "env": {
    "node": true,
    "es2021": true
  },
  "extends": "eslint:recommended",
  "parserOptions": {
    "ecmaVersion": 2021,
    "sourceType": "module"
  },
  "rules": {
    "semi": ["error", "always"],
    "quotes": ["error", "double"],
    "no-unused-vars": "error",
    "no-console": "warn"
  }
}
```

### Installing ESLint Dependencies

```bash
npm install --save-dev eslint
```

---

## 6. ⚙️ Enhanced GitHub Actions CI Workflow with Matrix Builds and Code Quality

I created an improved `.github/workflows/node.js.yml` file that incorporates matrix builds and code quality checks:

```yaml
name: Node.js CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [18.x, 20.x]

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Cache Node Modules
        uses: actions/cache@v4
        with:
          path: ~/.npm
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-node-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}
          restore-keys: |
            ${{ runner.os }}-node-

      - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
          cache: 'npm'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Run Linter
        run: npm run lint

      - name: Build project
        run: npm run build --if-present

      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
```

### Key Features:
- **Matrix strategy**: Tests against Node.js 18.x and 20.x versions
- **Efficient caching**: Caches node modules to speed up builds
- **Code quality gates**: Runs ESLint before building and testing
- **Proper step ordering**: Lint → Build → Test for optimal feedback

---

## 7. 📊 Managing Build Dependencies Efficiently

The workflow implements several strategies to optimize build performance:

### Caching Strategy
- **npm cache**: Caches `~/.npm` directory based on `package-lock.json` hash
- **Restore keys**: Provides fallback cache keys for partial matches
- **Built-in caching**: Uses `actions/setup-node@v4` with `cache: 'npm'`

### Dependency Management
- **npm ci**: Uses `npm ci` instead of `npm install` for faster, reliable installs
- **Lock file**: Ensures consistent dependency versions across environments

---

## 8. 🚀 AWS EC2 Deployment Workflow

I also set up a deployment pipeline to an AWS EC2 instance with proper dependency management:

### Deployment Workflow: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`

```yaml
name: Deploy to AWS EC2

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v4

    - name: Setup SSH key
      run: |
        mkdir -p ~/.ssh
        echo "${{ secrets.EC2_KEY }}" > ~/.ssh/id_rsa
        chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa

    - name: SSH and deploy
      run: |
        ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no ${{ secrets.EC2_USER }}@${{ secrets.EC2_HOST }} << 'EOF'
          cd /home/${{ secrets.EC2_USER }}/myapp
          git pull origin main
          npm ci
          npm run lint
          npm run build --if-present
          pm2 restart app || pm2 start index.js --name app
        EOF
```

---

## 9. 🧪 Testing and Experimentation Results

Through experimentation, I validated several key aspects:

### Matrix Build Testing
- **Parallel execution**: Confirmed jobs run simultaneously across different Node.js versions
- **Version compatibility**: Identified potential compatibility issues early
- **Build efficiency**: Reduced total pipeline time through parallelization

### Code Quality Integration
- **Early detection**: ESLint catches style and syntax issues before tests
- **Consistent standards**: Enforces coding standards across all contributions
- **Automated fixes**: `lint:fix` script enables automatic issue resolution

### Dependency Optimization
- **Cache hit rates**: Achieved significant build speed improvements with proper caching
- **Reliable installs**: `npm ci` ensures consistent dependency installation
